Practical Applications
Schools can use this model to:

Identify at-risk students early (95.7% recall for placed students)
Target intervention resources (counseling, interview prep, skills development)
Monitor placement trends over time
Make proactive rather than reactive decisions

The 90.9% accuracy provides practically useful performance for institutional deployment without requiring advanced deep learning expertise or infrastructure.

Future Directions

Expand dataset across multiple institutions for generalization testing
Incorporate additional behavioral features (extracurriculars, leadership)
Explore wider (rather than deeper) network architectures
Develop neural network interpretability for stakeholder trust
Investigate fairness across demographic groups
Test on datasets with more severe class imbalance
